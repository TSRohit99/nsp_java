# NEUB Student Portal

This is a Desktop application made with JAVA and JAVASWING (to render the GUI). This project is an implementation of CRUD operations on JAVA<>MongoDB.

## Documentation

This desktop application is designed for NEUB students and NEUB officials. Using this app, NEUB students can find their semester results (initially 1st and 2nd semesters), and NEUB officials can view any student's basic information. Additionally, officials have the capability to Create/Update/Delete student information in the database.

The project is structured using several Java classes, each with its own specific purpose:

- **Main():** This class serves as the starting UI for the application.

- **LoginPage():** Upon successful login, this page grants access to perform CRUD operations. In this project, access is limited to NEUB officials only, and the default credentials are set to 1,1.

- **Handler():** The core of the project, the Handler class serves as the connector between Java and MongoDB. It resolves all CRUD operations generated by the user and returns the data accordingly.
